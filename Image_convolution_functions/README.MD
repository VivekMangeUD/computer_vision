# Computer Vision Project

**Author:** Vivek Mange

This is a computer vision project that implements various image processing functions.

### Functions:

1. **convolve:** This function takes an input image (`Iinp`) and a kernel (`K`) to produce a convolved image. It applies the kernel over the image, performing element-wise multiplication and summing the results to highlight specific features.

2. **reduce:** This function reduces the input image (`Iinp`) to half its original width and height (`Iout`). It achieves this by removing alternate rows and columns, effectively downsampling the image.

3. **expand:** This function expands the input image (`Iinp`) to twice its original width and height (`Iout`). It interpolates new pixels between existing ones to upscale the image.

4. **GaussianPyramid(Iinp, n):** This function uses the "reduce" function to create a Gaussian pyramid with `n` levels. Each level is a lower resolution version of the previous one, created by consecutively removing rows and columns.

5. **LaplacianPyramids(Iinp, n):** This function builds an `n`-level Laplacian pyramid. Each level is generated by taking the difference between the corresponding level in the Gaussian pyramid and the expanded version of the next higher level.

6. **Reconstruct:** This function reconstructs the original image from the Laplacian pyramid (`LI`) with `n` levels. It collapses the pyramid by adding up each expanded level, and the error in reconstruction is reported using image difference.
